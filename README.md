# Global Superstore RFM Analysis
## Project Description
### Introduction
Recency, frequency, monetary value (RFM) is a model used in marketing analysis that segments a company’s consumer base by their purchasing patterns or habits. In particular, it evaluates customers’ recency (how long ago they made a purchase), frequency (how often they make purchases), and monetary value (how much money they spend).

RFM is then used to identify a company’s or an organization’s best customers by measuring and analyzing spending habits to improve low-scoring customers and maintain high-scoring ones.

The RFM model is based on three quantitative factors:
- Recency: number of days since last purchase
- Frequency: average orders during a certain period (for instance, number of monthly purchases)
- Monetary value: total order amount during a specific time frame

RFM analysis numerically ranks a customer in each of these three categories, generally on a scale of 1 to 5 (the higher the number, the better the result). When we combine these three factors, we can create a RFM ranking.

The segmentation is as follows:

### Insights and recommendation
- Potential loyalist account for the largest proportion in the list of customer segments (14.3%). These customers have made several orders with Superstore and might have come back recently, yet their total spending is quite low or just average. For this segment, Superstore is recommended to involve them in loyalty programs (membership program,...). There should be product recommendation and discount offers for them.
- Unfortunately, at risk, hibernating and lost customers segments rank second, third and fourth (12.1%, 11.4% and 10.5% respectively). 34% of Superstore customers have not made any recent purchases, which is alarming. For At risk and Hibernating customers, Superstore can send personalized messages, special offers, relevant product recommendations to reconnect with them. Lost customers can be ignored if both mass and personalized campaigns don't work for them
- For the most important segment, Champion (9.0%), Loyal (7.8%) and Cannot Lose Them (4.6%), Superstore needs to create a personalized, meaningful connection between customers and brand. Don't let competitors take these customers. Make them the brand ambassadors. Increase the proportion of these segments as currently, they account for a relatively small percentage.
